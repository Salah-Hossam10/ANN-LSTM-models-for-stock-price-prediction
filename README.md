Overview
Time series forecasting with LSTM is particularly suited to capturing the temporal dependencies in sequential data like stock prices. This project leverages a Netflix stock price dataset and includes preprocessing, model training, validation, and visualization.

Dataset
Source: Yahoo Finance
Features: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close.
Target Variable: Adjusted Close (closing stock price, adjusted for dividends and stock splits).
Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:

Two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.
Fully connected dense layers to output the stock price predictions.
Batch normalization for stable training.
Additional features like early stopping, learning rate adjustment, and batch normalization have been incorporated to enhance model performance.

Implementation
Data Preprocessing: The data is normalized for efficient model training, with sequences of 60 days used as input.
Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on historical stock price data, with a validation set used for early stopping.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate model performance.
Results
The model achieves a validation loss that indicates it effectively captures stock price trends. Further evaluation on test data shows the model's generalization capacity. Below is a sample plot comparing predictions vs. actual stock prices.

Future Work
Potential improvements and extensions include:

Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
Incorporation of other financial indicators.
Experimentation with other neural network architectures like GRU or Transformer-based models.
